Abstract: Star It App
Summary: We are working on an android application, that gives the actual location of  star in the sky with the help of its coordinates and star number. This is done with the help of Gps embedded on an Android Phone. We are using android Studio for developing the application. It is very helpful and interesting for space enthusiasts to get the position and angle of the star,instead of manually using a telescope. It gives more accurate value than a telescope, as it finds the current location of a star, based on current time and location, which is given by gps and a star Database of more than thousand stars.
There are many other apps such as google sky app, which gives the latitude and longitude of all the stars in the sky, but not the location of the stars, hence we came up with this idea, so that those who are interested in space can get a bigger idea about stars in the wide and never lasting sky.
